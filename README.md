# PRODUCTSTOCKGROUP FOR [DOLIBARR ERP CRM](https://www.dolibarr.org)

## Features

This module allows joint control of the stock of several products at the same time. For example, if there are similar products from different suppliers, it is possible to know when the sum of the stock of the set of products is below a minimum stock.

Other external modules are available on [Dolistore.com](https://www.dolistore.com).

## Installation

### From the ZIP file and GUI interface

If the module is a ready to deploy zip file, so with a name module_xxx-version.zip (like when downloading it from a market place like [Dolistore](https://www.dolistore.com)),
go into menu ```Home - Setup - Modules - Deploy external module``` and upload the zip file.

Note: If this screen tell you that there is no "custom" directory, check that your setup is correct:

- In your Dolibarr installation directory, edit the ```htdocs/conf/conf.php``` file and check that following lines are not commented:

    ```php
    //$dolibarr_main_url_root_alt ...
    //$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt ...
    ```

- Uncomment them if necessary (delete the leading ```//```) and assign a sensible value according to your Dolibarr installation

    For example :

    - UNIX:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = '/var/www/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

    - Windows:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = 'C:/My Web Sites/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

### From a GIT repository

Clone the repository in ```$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt/productstockgroup```

```sh
cd ....../custom
git clone git@github.com:gitlogin/productstockgroup.git productstockgroup
```
